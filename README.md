Grove Dust Sensor integrated into Home Assistant (ESP Home)

ESP Home ProtoType - BME280, D1Mini, Grove Dust Sensor

## Approach
This is using ESP Home (https://esphome.io/index.html) as the foundation coding and integration to Home Assistant (https://www.home-assistant.io/).

What is in this prototype:
1. BME280 using https://esphome.io/components/sensor/bmp280.html
2. A Grove Dust Sensor.  The Grove Dust Sensor is a nifty little device to see how dirty my workshop air is (I do woodworking hence it is pretty bad). Reference:  http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Dust_Sensor/

### Temperature
The code attempts to calculate the "apparent" temperature from https://planetcalc.com/2089/
However it is currently not giving a reasonable value on overcast and raining days - likely dufus (me) error in the calculation or understanding of how it should be done.

### Dust Sensor 
This is written as a non-blocking custom "Component" model in ESP Home.  The original Grove software was blocking - sampling the P1 pulse over a 30 second interval.  

Update() is from the PollingComponent class and is called every 2 mins (settable in the comstructor for the class).

Using some arduino interrupts to count the number of pulses during the polling interval as this seems more accurate than using pulseIn() in the loop() cycle; the latter seemed to be missing pulse starts and hence was less accurate IMO.  

## Compiling etc.
You will need to install ESP Home and Home Assistant if you want to use this.

ESP Home is best initially set up using the wizard as it will set up directories and code structures.  Once you get the hang of it, it is much like any other Arduino ESP8266 coding practice.

I used VSCode as the IDE and linked this back to my GITHUB environment.

ESP Home needs to be compiled in the CLI in a terminal (well for me at least) using:

`esphome probable_fornight.yaml compile`

To deploy it to a connects D1 Mini use:

`esphome probable_fornight.yaml run`
